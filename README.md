Spring-169

Spring compression algorithm:


Divide by long bits start from 16836 and move 1 bias of 1 bit of bits of information that we get after divide and it while we get 2^256 bits. In the finish add 1 after zero in the left after this 1 like 1, 01, 001, 0001, 00001, 000001, 0000001, 00000001, 000000001. In the end: Count how many times, size of file and number of divided 2^24 or 2^32. Everything is safe. Save every time size of the file and count times to compress: Example: How is a file looking: times of compression 6 bytes, size of file, compression number, Divide number and Bias number. 42B+-. Extaract move in bias and multiply it and add number from the another side. bit 0 -X or 1 +1. Save bias 7 bits 1 bit move 16836-=. Made by Jurijus Pacalovas.
